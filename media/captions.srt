1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:11,920
okay so um how about we talk about where

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:14,519
we want to go on vacation yeah

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,000
so what places would you like to go

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,519
visit I think it depends on the time of

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,320
year okay so and then it also depends on

6
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:29,519
the prices so we should go me and you

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,560
yeah just two maybe for the summer yeah

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,440
so during the summer it's really it's

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,000
more expensive oh that's true so we can

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,520
try going

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,680
like but see then we

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,079
have the Spring

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:52,039
Break um but then we also want it to be

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:55,800
warm yeah so would you want to do maybe

15
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,960
August yeah or September like September

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,920
yeah and then what we can do like what

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,920
specific place would you like to go to

18
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,600
I don't think we've been to the east

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:13,240
coast that much besides Florida yeah

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,040
besides Florida so we could go to like

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,520
where where I don't know all

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,159
I

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:26,079
no I think Maine is might be

24
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:30,119
cold we can probably look into like the

25
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,079
weather during that time main yeah and

26
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,479
then depending

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,000
on like we can look at different things

28
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,799
that are close by and just see what we

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,200
could do that sounds good all right so

30
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,399
it's settled then yeah we're good main

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,399
it is main August September
