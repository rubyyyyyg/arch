Okay so how about we talk about where we want to go on vacation? Yeah so what places would you like to go visit? I think it depends on the time of year. Okay so and then it also depends on the prices. So we should go me and you. Yeah just us two. Maybe for the summer. Yeah so during the summer it's really it's more expensive. Oh that's true so we can try going but see then we have the Spring Break but then we also want it to be warm. Yeah so would you want to do maybe August? Or September? Like September yeah and then what we can do like what specific place would you like to go to?

I don't think we've been to the east coast that much besides Florida. Yeah besides Florida, so we could go to like where? I don't know all I know, I think Maine might be cold. We can probably look into like the weather during that time. Maine yeah and then depending on like we can look at different things that are close by and just see what we could do. That sounds good, all right so it's settled then yeah we're going to Maine. Maine August or September.
