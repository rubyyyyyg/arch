WEBVTT

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.920
okay so um how about we talk about where

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.519
we want to go on vacation yeah

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.000
so what places would you like to go

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.519
visit I think it depends on the time of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.320
year okay so and then it also depends on

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:29.519
the prices so we should go me and you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.560
yeah just two maybe for the summer yeah

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
so during the summer it's really it's

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.000
more expensive oh that's true so we can

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.520
try going

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.680
like but see then we

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.079
have the Spring

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:52.039
Break um but then we also want it to be

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:55.800
warm yeah so would you want to do maybe

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.960
August yeah or September like September

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.920
yeah and then what we can do like what

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
specific place would you like to go to

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.600
I don't think we've been to the east

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:13.240
coast that much besides Florida yeah

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.040
besides Florida so we could go to like

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.520
where where I don't know all

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.159
I

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.079
no I think Maine is might be

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:30.119
cold we can probably look into like the

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.079
weather during that time main yeah and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.479
then depending

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.000
on like we can look at different things

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.799
that are close by and just see what we

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.200
could do that sounds good all right so

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.399
it's settled then yeah we're good main

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.399
it is main August September
